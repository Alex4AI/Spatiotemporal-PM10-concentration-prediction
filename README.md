# Spatiotemporal-PM10-concentration-prediction

## Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Project

In order to provide air quality forecasts, Plume Labs has built a unique database with readings collected by monitoring stations all over the world. The problem consists in predicting the PM10 concentration measured at some stations using urban features evaluated at the station location as well as the readings provided by the stations nearby. 


Repository contains two jupyter notebooks:

<b>Plume Labs :</b> EDA (exploratory data analysis), data cleaning, feature engineering, baseline model and random forest model (machine learning)

<b>Plume Labs - advanced :</b> RNN model (deep learning)
